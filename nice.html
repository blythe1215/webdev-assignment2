			Nice, the fifth largest city in France, acts as a magnet attracting people from all over the world, for a multitude of reasons, Not only renowned for its grace, Nice has become a hub for research in industry, science and advanced technology since the creation of such centers as Acropolis and Sophia Antipolis. The Palais de Congres, a convention center, can accomodate diverse functions. Both elegant and simple, Nice's charm comes from its exceptional climate as well as its beauty.

		<center><h1> My experience </h1></center>
    <p class = "nice-exp"> When me and my two friends were backpacking Europe, Nice provided the perfect relaxing spot in the middle of our trip. Prior to Nice, we went all over Germany, Austria, and Iceland where we engaged in rigourous hikes and spent hours walking the streets and sight seeing. Nice was the perfect city to wind down and relax. We spent all day at the beach, swimming in warm water and doing various water activities. At night, we walked around the city and hit up the bars which fairly popular but not nearly as packed as Barcalona or Prague. We stayed at a hostel where everyone was extremely friendly and we quickly made friends to explore the city with. I met some of the coolest people, from nomadic backpackers to tatoo artists, they all had some amazing stories to tell. </p>
